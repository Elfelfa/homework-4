# Homework 4: Coding Quiz

## Description

This application is a quiz on coding knowledge. When you press Start Game a timer will start. Each question you get wrong will decrease your time remaining by 12 seconds total. At the end of the quiz your remaining time is you score which can be recorded into the high scores board by entering your initials and pressing enter. Once you submit your score to the high scores it will take you to the score board to view how you compare to your previous scores. You can either clear the sores, or return to the game to try again. There is a timer at the top right of the page that allows you to track your remaining time, and a high scores link at the top left that will allow you to view the high scores whenever you like.
